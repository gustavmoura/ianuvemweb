                                technologies may be used (pixels, web beacons,
                                scripts). A cookie is a text file containing small
                                amounts of information which is downloaded to your
                                device when you access the App. The text file is
                                then sent back to the server each time you use the
                                App. This enables us to operate the App more
                                effectively. For example, we will know how many
                                users access specific areas or features within our
                                App and which links or ads they clicked on. We use
                                this aggregated information to understand and
                                optimize how our App is used, improve our marketing
                                efforts, and provide content and features that are
                                of interest to you. We may ask advertisers or other
                                partners to serve ads or services to the App, which
                                may use cookies or similar technologies.

                        <p>
                            Our App is not intended for children under the age of
                            eighteen (18). Therefore, we do not knowingly collect or
                            solicit any personal information from children under
                            eighteen (18). If you have not reached the age of
                            majority or legal age in your jurisdiction (i.e. if you
                            are between the ages of thirteen (13) and seventeen (17)
                            years), your use of the App is possible only with the
                            relevant consent and under the supervision of the holder
                            of parental responsibility for you.
                            <strong>No one under the age of thirteen (13) may provide
                                any personal information to the App.</strong>
                            If we learn that we have collected personal information
                            from a child under the age of eighteen (18) without
                            verification of the holder of parental responsibility
                            for a child, we will erase that information as quickly
                            as possible. If you believe that we might have any
                            information from or about a child under eighteen (18)
                            and data processing is carried out without the relevant
                            consent of the holder of parental responsibility for a
                            child, please contact us.
