                    age), or that you are an emancipated minor, or you

                    The App allows you to submit text and PDF-files (the “Input Content”)
                    and generate new original content based on it using AI

                    This means that you can do whatever you like with your
                    Input and Output Content - to publish it, to incorporate
                    it into other works, to print in any medium, to

                    If any controversy, allegation, or claim (including any

                    App and the Services provided by the App or this

                    of the dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it.
                    The notice shall be sent based on the most recent

                    from the date of receipt of notice from the other party,
                    you and us will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt
                    to resolve the dispute, though nothing will require
                    either you or us to resolve the dispute on terms which
                    either you or us, in each of our sole discretion, are
                    uncomfortable with.

                <p>
                    If at any time any provision of this Agreement is or
                    becomes illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any
                    respect, that provision shall be more narrowly construed
                    so that it becomes legal, valid and enforceable or, if
                    this is not possible, deleted. The other terms of this
                    Agreement shall continue to apply with full force and
                    effect.
                </p>
